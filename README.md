# ReflectionFactory

It's a simple example which shows how to use reflection with factory pattern

The example uses reports generation as a subject area

## Input params:
* int value of report type which be generated
* useful data for report

## How it works
* mark derived classes of base report via custom attribute with report type
* use reflection to find nesssary report class by custom attribute
* use reflection to create instance 

## P.S. This small example can be a good test task
Because used:
* basic *OOP*'s principles
* factory pattern
* reflection
* attributes
* secure coding

Also you can expand and complement it for your purposes
